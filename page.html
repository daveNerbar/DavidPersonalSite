                <p> Hello I'm David
                    Having a talent is amazing and awesome skill/s in our life,
                    because we have things that we can be proud or make us unique. If
                    you have a talent you can show it to others to show them what we
                    have. For me I have different talents like drawings, and dancing, but I
                    think that maybe I can show or maybe I can do singing and guitar.
                    For me, I am a little bit nervous because itâ€™s my first time to play
                    guitar and to sing in front of people, but I have courage to perform my
                    talent, because all my classmates also show their different talents. It
                    was very happy and enjoying because all of us show our talent. I was
                    excited to know what are their skills and talents.

                    <p> Some animals are cunning and evil-disposed, as the fox; others, as the dog,
                        are fierce, friendly, and fawning. Some are gentle and easily tamed, as the
                        elephant; some are susceptible of shame, and watchful, as the goose. Some are
                        jealous and fond of ornament, as the peacock.
                    </p>
                    <p>Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is thought
                        to aim at some good;and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to
                        be that at which all things aim.</p>

                    <p>A tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion.
                        Subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom
                        they consider god-fearing and pious. On the other hand, they do less
                        easily move against him, believing that he has the gods on his side.</p>
